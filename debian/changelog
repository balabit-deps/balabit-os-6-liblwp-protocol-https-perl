  * Team upload.

  [ gregor herrmann ]
  * debian/control: remove Nicholas Bamber from Uploaders on request of
    the MIA team.
  * Strip trailing slash from metacpan URLs.

  [ Salvatore Bonaccorso ]
  * Refresh cert.patch for offset
  * Add 746579-fix-peer-certificate-verification.patch patch.
    Fixes "HTTPS_CA_DIR or HTTPS_CA_FILE disables peer certificate
    verification for IO::Socket::SSL". When the intention was to only
    disable hostname verification LWP::Protocol::HTTPS disabled also the
    peer certificate verification completely. (CVE-2014-3230)
    Thanks to Jakub Wilk and Steffen Ullrich (Closes: #746579)
  * Update fix-https-proxy for fixed behaviour of LWP::Protocol::https
